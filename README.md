## What is financial trading?

### Introduction

* Beneath all the terminology, there's one ***core principle*** that underpins financial trading: predicting whether something will ***go up*** in price, or down. 
* Get it right and there's opportunity for great rewards and get it wrong you could lose a lot of money.
* Looking at ***what, where*** and ***how*** you can trade.

### What is financial trading?

* Financial trading is the ***buying and selling of financial instruments***.
* ***Shares***: ***small units of ownership*** in a company, such as Apple, Google, HSBC.
* ***Indices***: the ***value of a group of companies***, represented as a single number. E.g. the FTSE 100, S&P 500, Nikkei 225...
* ***Forex***: ***global currencies***, including the pound, dollar, euro...
* ***Commodities***: ***physical assets***, ***raw materials*** and ***agricultural products***, e.g. gold, oil and corn...

People and companies often trade ***financial instruments*** because they need ***assets*** for themselves or their business. For example, you may be travelling from Europe to the USA and want to convert euros to dollars and to do this you would participate in the forex market.

However, most of the time financial traders don't need assets at all. They are simply looking to make a profit from movements in the price, for example by ***buying low***, then ***selling high***.

### What are the financial markets?

* Financial markets are where buyers and sellers come to trade. They are often ***physical locations*** where traders meet to exchange a certain type of asset.
* E.g. Shares at the ***London Stock Exchange(LSE)***; Commodities at the ***Chicago Mercantile Exchange(CME)***.
* They can also be electronic systems, such as: the ***NASDAQ*** stock exchange and the ***forex*** market.

## Why trade?

Imagine one day you decided to put all your savings under the mattress for safekeeping. In real terms, the money would be worth ***less than*** when you put it there, because the ***cost of living*** is likely to have ***risen*** in the interim.

Instead of lying dormant, you can used that money to buy financial assets such as shares or commodities and have a greater potential growth as the value of those shares or commodities could go up.

Trading the financial markets is all about ***balancing that risk*** with the ***potential award***, and picking assets likely to move in your favour.

### Investing vs trading

* Investing is a ***long-term*** form of financial trading which involves buying and ***holding*** financial assets over a number of months or years.

* But long-term investing isn't the only way of participating in the financial markets, there's also ***active trading***, sometimes known as ***speculation***.
* While investors generally focus on the long-term value of assets and attempt to build a portfolio that will perform well in the future, ***active traders*** tend to focus on short-term market movements, with some participants placing hundreds of trades per day.

## What are equities?

### Why do companies offer shares?

#### To raise money

* By allowing investors to buy part of the company, the management are able to ***raise capital*** to put back into the business.
* If the funds are used wisely and the company becomes more profitable as a result, the value of the share price, and therefore the business, should ***rise***.
* The company and its shareholder are heavily ***reliant*** on each other: The company needs shareholders to ***raise funds***, and the shareholders hope the company will use their investment to ***grow the business*** - so they can make a ***profit***.

### Why do share prices move?

* The amount of share fluctuates is known as its ***volatility***.
* Whether a share price moves up or down is based fundamentally on the ***laws of supply*** and ***demand***.
* If more people want to buy a share then sell it, the price will ***rise*** because the share is ***more sought-after*** (the 'demand' outstrips the 'supply').
* Conversely, if supply is greater than demand, then the price will fall.

Supply and demand can be influenced by many factors, but the main two are:

* Earnings: If the earnings are ***better than*** expected, the share price generally ***rises***. If the earnings ***disappoint***, the share price is likely to ***fall***.
