## What is financial trading?

### Introduction

* Beneath all the terminology, there's one ***core principle*** that underpins financial trading: predicting whether something will ***go up*** in price, or down. 
* Get it right and there's opportunity for great rewards and get it wrong you could lose a lot of money.
* Looking at ***what, where*** and ***how*** you can trade.

### What is financial trading?

* Financial trading is the ***buying and selling of financial instruments***.
* ***Shares***: ***small units of ownership*** in a company, such as Apple, Google, HSBC.
* ***Indices***: the ***value of a group of companies***, represented as a single number. E.g. the FTSE 100, S&P 500, Nikkei 225...
* ***Forex***: ***global currencies***, including the pound, dollar, euro...
* ***Commodities***: ***physical assets***, ***raw materials*** and ***agricultural products***, e.g. gold, oil and corn...

People and companies often trade ***financial instruments*** because they need ***assets*** for themselves or their business. For example, you may be travelling from Europe to the USA and want to convert euros to dollars and to do this you would participate in the forex market.

However, most of the time financial traders don't need assets at all. They are simply looking to make a profit from movements in the price, for example by ***buying low***, then ***selling high***.

### What are the financial markets?

* Financial markets are where buyers and sellers come to trade. They are often ***physical locations*** where traders meet to exchange a certain type of asset.
* E.g. Shares at the ***London Stock Exchange(LSE)***; Commodities at the ***Chicago Mercantile Exchange(CME)***.
* They can also be electronic systems, such as: the ***NASDAQ*** stock exchange and the ***forex*** market.

## Why trade?

Imagine one day you decided to put all your savings under the mattress for safekeeping. In real terms, the money would be worth ***less than*** when you put it there, because the ***cost of living*** is likely to have ***risen*** in the interim.

Instead of lying dormant, you can used that money to buy financial assets such as shares or commodities and have a greater potential growth as the value of those shares or commodities could go up.

Trading the financial markets is all about ***balancing that risk*** with the ***potential award***, and picking assets likely to move in your favour.

### Investing vs trading

* Investing is a ***long-term*** form of financial trading which involves buying and ***holding*** financial assets over a number of months or years.

* But long-term investing isn't the only way of participating in the financial markets, there's also ***active trading***, sometimes known as ***speculation***.
* While investors generally focus on the long-term value of assets and attempt to build a portfolio that will perform well in the future, ***active traders*** tend to focus on short-term market movements, with some participants placing hundreds of trades per day.

## What are equities?

### Why do companies offer shares?

#### To raise money

* By allowing investors to buy part of the company, the management are able to ***raise capital*** to put back into the business.
* If the funds are used wisely and the company becomes more profitable as a result, the value of the share price, and therefore the business, should ***rise***.
* The company and its shareholder are heavily ***reliant*** on each other: The company needs shareholders to ***raise funds***, and the shareholders hope the company will use their investment to ***grow the business*** - so they can make a ***profit***.

### Why do share prices move?

* The amount of share fluctuates is known as its ***volatility***.
* Whether a share price moves up or down is based fundamentally on the ***laws of supply*** and ***demand***.
* If more people want to buy a share then sell it, the price will ***rise*** because the share is ***more sought-after*** (the 'demand' outstrips the 'supply').
* Conversely, if supply is greater than demand, then the price will fall.

Supply and demand can be influenced by many factors, but the main two are:

* ***Earnings***: If the earnings are ***better than*** expected, the share price generally ***rises***. If the earnings ***disappoint***, the share price is likely to ***fall***. The firm's share price can be particularly ***volatile*** immediately before and after the announcement, especially if the figures are significantly ***better*** or ***worse*** than anticipated.
* ***Sentiment***: Share prices tend to react ***strongly*** to expectations of the company's future performance, which are built on any number of factors such as upcoming industry legislation, public faith in the company's management team or the general health of the economy.

## Trading shares

### How are shares traded?

* Major shares are traded on the stock market. E.g. The marjority of UK shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), while most US shares can be found on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ.

### What is a stockbroker?

* The role of the stockbroker is to ***buy and sell*** stocks on their clients' behalf.
* Nowadays, this process is almost always conducted ***online***.

There are three main types of broker:

* ***Full-service***: ***Create*** and ***execute*** a strategy based on the investment goals of the client - trading on their behalf. (***High commission***)
* ***Advisory***: Provide ***investment advice*** and ***recommend*** specific trades, but leave the final decision to the client. (***Medium commission***)
* ***Execution-only***: Simply carry out the client's trading instructions, usually via an online platform. ***No advice given***. (***Low commission***)

### Trading times

* Shares are only traded during the opening hours of their designated stock exchange.

### How do shares become listed on an exchange?

* Companies are either ***privately owned*** or ***public***.
* A private company isn't ***listed*** on a major stock exchange, so you would usually have to contact the owners directly to buy shares. They are under ***no obligation*** to sell them.
* If the owners want to 'go public' to raise some capital or boost the company's reputation, they must carry out an initial public offering, or ***IPO***.
* Publically-listed companies often have many ***more shareholders*** than private ones, and are subject to ***much tighter*** regulations.

### Dividends

* A key advantage to investing in shares is the potential for dividends.
* A dividend is an amount of money paid to shareholders, representing a ***portion of*** the company's profits.
* Dividends can ***compensate*** for a share price that isn't moving much, giving shareholders ***an income*** instead.
* Companies that are ***expanding rapidly*** usually don't offer dividends, choosing instead to ***reinvest*** all their profits to ***sustain growth***.

## What are stock indices?

* A stock index is a ***measurement*** of value of a ***certain section*** of the stock market.
* This ***certain section*** of the stock market can be: an ***exchange***(NASDAQ), a ***region***(such as Europe or Asia) or a ***sector***(energy, electronics, etc)

### Why are they important?

* Stock indices give traders and investors an ***indication*** of how an exchange, region or sector is performing.
* E.g. the ASX 200, tracks the performance of 200 of the largest companies in Australia. A rising ASX 200 tells investors that, generally, the state of the Australian stock market is ***improving***. If the Australian stock market is on the up, then more often than not, the entire Aussie economy tends to be ***doing well***.

### What are the major stock indices?

In the US, there are several major indices, all based on slightly different ***sections*** of the market. The three main US indices are: 

* ***Dow Jones Industrial Average***: One of the oldest and most quoted indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average represents 30 of the most influential companies in the US.
* ***S&P 500***: More diverse than DJIA, the S&P 500 is based on the value of 500 of the largest US shares listed on either NYSE or NASDAQ. Today represents around 70% of the total value the US stock market.
* ***NASDAQ-100***: Based on 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ exchange in New York City. It represents firms across a number sections, but in particular ***computing, telecommunications*** and ***biotechnology***.

## Trading stock indices

* Most major indices are either calculated using a ***capitalisation-weighted*** or a ***price-wweighted*** system.

### Capitalisation-weighted system

* This system takes the ***size*** of each company into account when calculating the value of the index as a whole. So the more a particular company is worth, the more its share price will affect the index.
* You can tell how much a particular company is worth by ***multiplying*** its share price by the ***number of shares issued***. This is called its ***market capitalisation***.

### Price-weighted system

* This method is based on the ***actual share price*** of the companies in the index, rather than their overall size.
* The ***higher*** the share price, the ***more influence*** that company has on the value of the index.

### How do you trade stock indices?

* You cannot buy or sell them directly, there's no asset to own and nothing to exchange. Therefore, to trade on the price of an index, you need to choose a product that ***mirrors*** its performance.

#### Index Fund

* A specialised investment fund that attempts to ***replicate*** the movements of a particular stock index.

#### Exchange-traded fund (ETF)

* A distincty type of index fund that can be traded like a stock on an exchange.

#### Derivatives

* Financial products that derive their price from the performance of an underlying instrument. E.g. futures, options, digital 100s, spread bets or contracts for difference (CFDs).

## What is forex?

* Forex, also known as foreign exchange is the largest financial market in the world. On average over $5 trillion worth of transactions take place every day.
* That's around 100 times more than the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) - the world's biggest stock exchange.

### Who trades forex?

* By far the most signifanct players in the forex market are the major international banks. Between, them, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, JPMorgan and UBS account for around 50% of global forex trade.

### Why do people trade forex?

* ***Speculation***: Simply to make money. With major financial institutions always looking to profit from small changes in forex prices, many large trades can occur throughout the day. This activity means currency rates are some of the ***most consistently volatile*** financial markets in the world - which in turn provides more opportunity for speculators to make money.
* ***Purchasing goods or services in another currency***: Everyy time a transaction is made between two entities in different regions, a foreign exchange transaction needs to take place to pay for the goods or services exchanged.

### How do you trade forex?

* Forex is an over-the-counter (OTC) market. Currencies are exchanged directly between two parties rather than through an exchange.

<img src = "https://github.com/Louisli0515/Introducing-the-financial-markets-IG-Academy/assets/128298224/dcbe88cb-9064-4279-9bfc-73a78151f30a" width = 75% height = 75%>

* In partice, that means you can trade most forex pairs from around 21:00 or 22:00 (UK time) on Sunday to 21:00 or 22:00 (UK time) on Friday every week.

### How does a forex trade work?

* Forex prices are always quoted in ***pairs*** such as AUD/EUR. This is because if you want to purchase Australian dollars you need to buy them with euros.
* When trading forex you are ***simultaneously BUYING*** on currency while ***SELLING*** another.
* The first currency in every forex pair is called the ***base*** or ***primary*** currency. The second currency is known as the ***quote*** or ***counter*** currency.
* You would ***buy*** a pair if you think the base currency will strengthen against the quote currency, this is known as going ***long***. Or you could ***sell*** the pair if you believe the base currency will weaken, this is going ***short***.

## Trading forex

### What is a 'pip'?

* Unlike share price movements, which are measured in recognisable units of currency such as pence or cents, forex changes are measured in very samll units called ***pips***.
* For example, if the EUR/USD price moves from 1.20160 to 1.20170, that 0.0001 USD rise in value represents ***one pip***.
* For most major currency pairs, a pip represents a ***one-digit*** move in the ***fourth*** decimal place.
* One important ***exception*** to this is where the ***yen*** is the counter currency. Here, the ***second*** decimal place is the one to watch.
* Any extra decimal places shown in the price are known as ***fractional pips*** or ***pipettes***.

### What is a 'lot'?

* Each one-pip movement in a forex price is only worth a tiny amouont. So, to take advantage of these small changes in value, forex is traditionally traded in large batches called ***lots***.
* A standard lot is 100,000 units of currency.
* Small investors generally don't have access to such large amounts of money, so many forex brokers allow clients to trade on ***leverage***.
* Leverage essentially means you can open a large market position with a relatively small deposit - called ***margin***.

### Major pairs

The majority of forex trades take place on a few select currency pairs called the ***majors***. Usually are:
* EUR/USD
* USD/JPY
* GBP/USD
* USD/CHF(Swiss franc)
* USD/CAD
* AUD/USD

### Minor and exotic pairs

* Pairs which are traded less frequently are known as ***minor*** currency pairs.
* Also seem them called ***cross-currency*** pairs or simply ***crosses***, particularly if the US dollar isn't involved. (The most popular minor pairs tend to contain EUR, GBP and JPY.)
* Some forex brokers may also refer to ***exotic*** or ***emerging*** pairs.
* You may come across forex classes which are based on a region, such as ***Australasian*** pairs or ***Scandinavian*** pairs. 

### What drives the forex markets?

* In general terms, the ***stronger*** the economy of a country, the ***stronger*** its currency will be compared to other currencies.

Therefore, the factors that affect a country's economy tend to have the ***greatest*** influence on a currency's price. These include:

* Interest rates
* Inflation rates
* Government policy
* Demand for imports and exports
* Economic statistics such as a county's growth figures, unemployment levels and manufacturing data

## What are commodities?

* Commodities are physical assets. They are ***raw materials*** mined, farmed or extracted from the earth. Examples include: Gold, Oil, Wheat and Cattle.
* To be officially ***tradable***, a commodity must be entirely ***interchangeable*** with another commodity of the same type, no matter where it was produced, mined or farmed.
* Economists call this being ***fungible*** and it means large quantities of commodities can be traded relatively quickly and easily on an exchange. This is because every trader can be confident they are buying/selling equivalent assets without needing to inspect them, or find out where or how they are produced.

### Types of commodity

Commodities are often placed into two groups:

* ***Soft commodities***: These are agricultural commodities, farmed rather than mined or extracted. Softs tend to be very ***volatile*** in the ***short term***, as they are susceptible to seasonal growing cycles, weather and spoilage which can suddenly and dramatically affect prices.
* ***Hard commodities***: These are generally mined from the ground, or taken from other natural resources. They are typically easier to handle and transport than softs, and are more easily integrated into the industrial process.

Commodities can also be classified according to their ecological sector:
* Energy (oil and gas)
* Metal (gold, silver, copper, lead, etc)
* Agriculture (wheat, coffee, livestock, etc)

### How are they traded?

There are two main ways to trade commodities:

* ***The spot market***: The spot market is where financial assets are sold for cash and exchanged right there and then. So if you need ***immediate delivery*** of a commmodity, you would head to the spot market.
* ***The futures market***: The futures market is a place where buyers and sellers agree to exchange ***a specific quantity of an asset at a fixed date in the future, at a price agreed today***.
* The price of futures contracts tends to be different from buying or selling an identical amount of that same commodity on the spot market. That's because the seller needs to take into account future risks and charges, such as the cost to hold the commodity and then transport it to the buyer. Hence, futures contracts are valued using ***forward prices***, rather than spot prices.

### Who trades commodity futures?

There are four main types of commodity futures trader.

* ***Producers***: These are companies/individuals that produce or extrract commodities and enter into a futures contract to offset the risk of future price movements.
* ***Speculators***: These are traders looking solely to ***profit*** on commodity price movements.
* ***Hedgers***: These are mid or long-term investors who hold commodities in their portfolio to provide protection against downward movements in other securities. Commodities tend to move in an ***opposite direction*** (or at least an unconnected direction) to certain stocks and bonds.
* ***Brokers***: These are firms or individuals who buy and sell commodity contracts on behalf of their clients.
