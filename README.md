## What is financial trading?

### Introduction

* Beneath all the terminology, there's one ***core principle*** that underpins financial trading: predicting whether something will ***go up*** in price, or down. 
* Get it right and there's opportunity for great rewards and get it wrong you could lose a lot of money.
* Looking at ***what, where*** and ***how*** you can trade.

### What is financial trading?

* Financial trading is the ***buying and selling of financial instruments***.
* ***Shares***: ***small units of ownership*** in a company, such as Apple, Google, HSBC.
* ***Indices***: the ***value of a group of companies***, represented as a single number. E.g. the FTSE 100, S&P 500, Nikkei 225...
* ***Forex***: ***global currencies***, including the pound, dollar, euro...
* ***Commodities***: ***physical assets***, ***raw materials*** and ***agricultural products***, e.g. gold, oil and corn...

People and companies often trade ***financial instruments*** because they need ***assets*** for themselves or their business. For example, you may be travelling from Europe to the USA and want to convert euros to dollars and to do this you would participate in the forex market.

However, most of the time financial traders don't need assets at all. They are simply looking to make a profit from movements in the price, for example by ***buying low***, then ***selling high***.

### What are the financial markets?

* Financial markets are where buyers and sellers come to trade. They are often ***physical locations*** where traders meet to exchange a certain type of asset.
* E.g. Shares at the ***London Stock Exchange(LSE)***; Commodities at the ***Chicago Mercantile Exchange(CME)***.
* They can also be electronic systems, such as: the ***NASDAQ*** stock exchange and the ***forex*** market.
