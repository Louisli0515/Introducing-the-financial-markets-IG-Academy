## What is financial trading?

### Introduction

* Beneath all the terminology, there's one ***core principle*** that underpins financial trading: predicting whether something will ***go up*** in price, or down. 
* Get it right and there's opportunity for great rewards and get it wrong you could lose a lot of money.
* Looking at ***what, where*** and ***how*** you can trade.

### What is financial trading?

* Financial trading is the ***buying and selling of financial instruments***.
* ***Shares***: ***small units of ownership*** in a company, such as Apple, Google, HSBC.
* ***Indices***: the ***value of a group of companies***, represented as a single number. E.g. the FTSE 100, S&P 500, Nikkei 225...
* ***Forex***: ***global currencies***, including the pound, dollar, euro...
* ***Commodities***: ***physical assets***, ***raw materials*** and ***agricultural products***, e.g. gold, oil and corn...

People and companies often trade ***financial instruments*** because they need ***assets*** for themselves or their business. For example, you may be travelling from Europe to the USA and want to convert euros to dollars and to do this you would participate in the forex market.

However, most of the time financial traders don't need assets at all. They are simply looking to make a profit from movements in the price, for example by ***buying low***, then ***selling high***.

### What are the financial markets?

* Financial markets are where buyers and sellers come to trade. They are often ***physical locations*** where traders meet to exchange a certain type of asset.
* E.g. Shares at the ***London Stock Exchange(LSE)***; Commodities at the ***Chicago Mercantile Exchange(CME)***.
* They can also be electronic systems, such as: the ***NASDAQ*** stock exchange and the ***forex*** market.

## Why trade?

Imagine one day you decided to put all your savings under the mattress for safekeeping. In real terms, the money would be worth ***less than*** when you put it there, because the ***cost of living*** is likely to have ***risen*** in the interim.

Instead of lying dormant, you can used that money to buy financial assets such as shares or commodities and have a greater potential growth as the value of those shares or commodities could go up.

Trading the financial markets is all about ***balancing that risk*** with the ***potential award***, and picking assets likely to move in your favour.

### Investing vs trading

* Investing is a ***long-term*** form of financial trading which involves buying and ***holding*** financial assets over a number of months or years.
